        <h2>When thinking on a possible future I think of cultural practices that can be passed from generation to generation</h2>
        <p><strong>Thesis:</strong></p> 
<p> My concept was to explore the future of Estonian culture in an environment overrun by technology, where folk culture and clothing are trying to remain relevant, examining the phenomenon of traditional cultures battling negligibility in the modern day, and speculating on the concept of human rituals adapting to a tech-centered reality.
This future is inhabited by humans affected by pro tech-based companies pushing for less traditional practices in the name of progress, while undermined cultures are trying to maintain their traditional rituals. 
This needs to be imagined to help understand cultural rituals in order to prevent them from dying out; understanding the systems of generational memory of Estonian folk clothing practice to prevent extinction. This future takes place in 2070 where the older generation has died out and are unable to continue teaching the traditional clothing construction practices. This future is viewed through a technological and cultural lens to gain a better understanding of how they are able to mesh in a respectful way.
